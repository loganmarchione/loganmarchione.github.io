<p>When I was running WordPress, I was using Matomo (formerly Piwik) for analytics. This solution worked for me, but was more complicated than I needed, and I didn&rsquo;t make use of 99% of the features.

<p>I did this to protect my users and respect their privacy.

<p>In the end, I decided on Plausible analytics because:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are privacy-respecting</li>
<li>they are GDPR-compliant (e.g., no cookies, no individual user tracking, no PII, etc&hellip;) and don&rsquo;t require a pop-up for consent</li>
<li>they are the most affordable SaaS solution (and offer a 30-day free trial)</li>
<li>they have a lightweight (&lt;1KB) JavaScript tag</li>
<li>they offer simple dashboards</li>
<li>they are independent developers</li>
</ul>
