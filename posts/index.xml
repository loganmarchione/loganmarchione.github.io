      <description>Introduction I spend a lot of time on Reddit in r/devops, r/homelab, and r/selfhosted, where I always see different versions of the same question:
It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get hands-on experience in DevOps. What is a good beginner project?
I&amp;rsquo;ve posted this answer to Reddit multiple times before, but this post will have more detail.
Static site Build a static site. That&amp;rsquo;s the answer.

      <description>Introduction This post serves no real purpose other than to match SEO keywords for people searching for PCIe WiFi cards for Linux.
My desktop is on the third floor of my house, unfortunately without wired internet. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a PCIe 802.11n (WiFi 4) card since 2016 and realized it&amp;rsquo;s time to upgrade.
TP-Link TL-WDN4800

      <description>TL;DR I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated by Mozilla, but don&amp;rsquo;t see many alternative browsers that have such noble goals as Firefox.
Introduction I have a confession: I tried really hard to quit Firefox, but I can&amp;rsquo;t.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Firefox since the single-digit release days, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing my Firefox config for five years now. In a recent experiment, I used Brave Browser exclusively for three months, but ended up moving back to Firefox.</description>

      <description>TL;DR In my opinion, these self-hosted, open-source applications are the best of what open-source can be.
Home Assistant Jellyfin Pi-hole Nextcloud WordPress Introduction My hot water tank recently leaked, but (luckily for me) there was a floor drain right next to it. The next day (after having the tank fixed), I purchased a water leak sensor, added it to Home Assistant in under 2 minutes, and was able to get push notifications of future detected leaks.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get my homelab applications moved from running on VM/LXC to Docker. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with VMs or LXC containers, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to manage fewer servers and &amp;ldquo;snowflakes&amp;rdquo; (even though I do my installs with Ansible).
The application that started my homelab journey was DokuWiki. It&amp;rsquo;s a self-hosted wiki, written in PHP, that requires no database. You write in a Markdown-like syntax (not Markdown) and your data is stored in plain TXT files on the filesystem.</description>

However, if you&amp;rsquo;re managing a fleet of Raspberry Pi devices, or just really like configuration management tools, you&amp;rsquo;re probably looking for a way to automate setting these items from the command line.</description>

      <description>Introduction When I was running WordPress, I was using Matomo (formerly Piwik) for analytics. This solution worked for me, but was more complicated than I needed, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t make use of 99% of the features. It also required PHP and MySQL/MariaDB, which were not installed on the new server hosting my Hugo-based blog. Because of this, I wanted to switch to a simpler analytics solution.
Self-hosted vs SaaS For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve hosted a Matomo instance on my server and proudly stated in my privacy policy:</description>

Why I&amp;rsquo;m switching You can Google &amp;ldquo;wordpress to hugo&amp;rdquo; and read 1000 posts about why people make the switch. Here are my reasons:
Security WordPress is written in PHP, which has an unfairly bad reputation.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m on a quest to SSL all the things on my local network. I work in IT security, and am more than paranoid when it comes to my homelab (shout-out to r/homelab and r/selfhosted).
For my web applications, everything is accessed through a Nginx reverse proxy that uses Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt wildcard certificates (using the DNS challenge) for encryption. It provides a single choke-point for all my traffic, all using one wildcard certificate, and all my clients accept it with the green lock.</description>

      <description>Introduction In my last post, I went over linting Ansible playbooks manually. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to give you a brief introduction on how to lint playbooks automatically, using Drone.
I was inspired to post this after watching Jeff Geerling&amp;rsquo;s (geerlingguy on Github) Ansible 101 YouTube series. In it, he mentions using automated testing/linting of his playbooks. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it, give it a watch.

      <description>Introduction What is Ansible? If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you probably already know what Ansible is, so I won&amp;rsquo;t spend a lot of time here.
Ansible is open-source configuration management software. It lets you configure one machine, or 100 machines, in the same way, every time. You can use Ansible to install software, create users, update files, etc&amp;hellip; Basically, if it&amp;rsquo;s a task that can be automated, Ansible can do it.</description>

      <description>TL;DR Skip to the bottom.
Introduction I receive a lot of email questions about my resume, specifically asking why I use LaTeX, and also asking for the source (which is at the very bottom). I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a few minutes to discuss why I use LaTeX.
For the past 10 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing my resume in Microsoft Word. Over time, it had become a burden to update. More often than not, I ended up fighting with the formatting, instead of focusing on the content.</description>

      <description>Introduction WireGuard released their official iOS app today, and I wasted no time jumping on setting up a WireGuard server at home (based mostly on this guide). This is not going to be a tutorial, but instead, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about why WireGuard is a game-changer.
OpenVPN drawbacks For years, I&amp;rsquo;ve used OpenVPN to connect back to my home network. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, OpenVPN is great, especially compared to dated, insecure alternatives like PPTP or L2TP/IPSec.</description>

      <description>Introduction In March of 2018, Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt (the free Certificate Authority) announced they added support for wildcard certificates through the upgraded ACMEv2 protocol. I&amp;rsquo;ve been hosting most of my services on subdirectories (e.g., loganmarchione.com/rss) but have been wanting to move them to subdomains (e.g., rss.loganmarchione.com), and thought this was the perfect chance to do just that.
What are wildcard certificates? Wildcard certificates cover any subdomain of a specific domain. For example, I own loganmarchione.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work on my homelab that I haven&amp;rsquo;t documented here.
I recently decommissioned my Raspberry Pi 3 that was running my Unifi controller, Dokuwiki, and Network UPS Tools (NUT). I replaced the RPi3 with an Intel i3 NUC with 12GB RAM and a Crucial 2.5&amp;quot; SSD. I chose to use Proxmox as the hypervisor on the NUC because it is open source, has a well-proven record, and has a low learning curve.</description>

      <description>Introduction While creating CAA records, I found myself needing a new DNS provider. During that process, I thought it would be a good idea to document what it take to host a website and how the internet works (in a very limited sense). To host a website on the public internet, you need three things:
domain name DNS record(s) web host Typically, most domain registrars offer basic DNS support. In addition, most web hosts also offer basic DNS support.</description>

      <description>Introduction Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) is a new DNS record specifying which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue certificates for a domain. Introduced by RFC 6844, CAA protects websites by only allowing certificates to be issued by specific CAs. If an attacker were to take over a website, they would only be able to obtain a certificate from a CA specified in DNS CAA records, limiting the damage they could do.</description>

3 backups 2 different types of media 1 backup offsite Current setup Currently, I keep an encrypted external HDD at home and another at work. Every couple weeks, I perform a backup to both and rotate the drives (this covers a 2-1-1 backup).</description>

      <description>Introduction Put on your tinfoil hats, boys and girls! Today, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about security, encryption, and GPG!
PGP vs OpenPGP vs GPG PGP Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) was a program created to encrypt/decrypt data in 1991 by Phil Zimmermann. Zimmermann formed PGP Incorporated, which was acquired serveral times and is now owned by Symantec.
Fun fact - in 1993 the US government charged Zimmerman with¬†&amp;ldquo;munitions export without a license&amp;rdquo;. At the time, cryptography systems with keys over 40 bits were considered a weapon, and since PGP used 128 bit keys, Zimmerman was in violation of the law.</description>

      <description>Update: LUKS2 is out, use it instead! LUKS2 was released in 2018, you should double-check the documentation for it before you blindly follow this guide. üôÉ
Introduction Since TrueCrypt is no longer under active development, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to wipe my external drives and re-encrypt them with LUKS and dm-crypt. These are standard Linux tools that are available by default in most distributions. I&amp;rsquo;ve used LUKS and dm-crypt in the past, when I installed Arch Linux on my laptop.</description>

      <title>UPDATE: TrueCrypt may not be secure</title>
      <link>https://loganmarchione.github.io/2014/06/update-truecrypt-may-not-be-secure/</link>

      <description>Ever since TrueCrypt disappeared a few days ago, there has been a lot of speculation as to what happened. There are plenty of theories on r/netsec, r/linx, and r/crypto. Even Bruce Schneier doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going on.
There is a theory that the developer threw in the towel, however, the most popular theory going around is that the NSA/FBI/other-three-letter-organization was involved and this is TrueCrypt&amp;rsquo;s warrant canary. Because they would not legally be allowed to divulge the fact that they were being forced to backdoor their software, they decided to suggest alternatives known to be backdoored, knowing that users would understand the secret message.</description>

      <description>Recently, I posted three articles of a four-part series showing how to encrypt an external drive with TrueCrypt on Fedora 20. As-of today, May 28th, TrueCrypt may not be secure after-all.
The truecrypt.org website now redirects to truecrypt.sourceforge.net. A warning is displayed that reads, &amp;ldquo;WARNING: Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues&amp;rdquo; and it directs users to alternative encryption packages for Windows, Mac, and Linux.</description>

      <title>UPDATE: Dropping Dropbox</title>
      <link>https://loganmarchione.github.io/2014/04/update-dropping-dropbox/</link>

      <description>In March, I cancelled my subscription to Dropbox over privacy concerns. Seems like that was a good idea.
Dropbox just announced that they&amp;rsquo;re adding Dr. Condoleezza Rice to their Board of Directors. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to tell you why this is a terrible idea.
See the official petition here, and my letter to Dropbox customer service below.
To whom it may concern,
I have been a paid subscriber to Dropbox since 2010, and have loved every minute of your service since day 1.</description>

      <description>I dropped Dropbox!¬†Well, not entirely.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Dropbox user since Day 1. I remember when their service was first introduced. Cloud storage was just coming out and it was so convenient to be able to access your data anywhere.
I quickly outgrew the 2GB free limit, earned a few extra GB through DropQuest, and then decided to start paying for their storage. For the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been paying $99/yr for 100GB of space.</description>
