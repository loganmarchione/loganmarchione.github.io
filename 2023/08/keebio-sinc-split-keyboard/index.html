A traditional keyboard can cause a few ergonomic problems:\nUlnar Deviation - This is when your wrists bend outwards (toward your pinky finger) and can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Image from Kinesis\nForearm Pronation - When typing with your palms face-down, it causes your radius and ulna to twist, which can lead to poor circulation and repetitive strain injuries (RSI). Image from Kinesis\nWrist extension - This is when your wrists bend upwards and can cause poor circulation and numbness. Image from Kinesis\nThere are a number of ways to solve these problems, but the “perfect” keyboard would be:\nSplit in half to allow the arms to naturally rest shoulder-width apart (not bending the wrists) Each half would be slightly tilted downwards to allow the forearms to sit naturally (not twisting the radius and ulna) The slope of the keyboard would be minimized (or zero) to allow the wrists to rest naturally (this could also be accomplished by raising the wrists with a rest) It won’t win any awards for looks, but the Kinesis Freestyle2 with the VIP3 tenting and palm rest kit is designed to tackle these exact problems (also note the ergonomic vertical mouse).\nImage from Kinesis\nMy options Unfortunately, the Kinesis Freestyle2 isn’t “aesthetic” and is lacking a lot of enthusiast-level niceties (hotswap sockets, QMK support, USB-C, etc…).\nBelow are the keyboards I considered. They don’t solve all ergonomic challenges, but they’re all split boards (you’ll need to scroll left and right to see the entire table).\nItem Starting price Size Layout Hotswap Connectivity Software Thumb cluster Wrist-wrist Tenting Comments Dygma Raise $399 60% Staggered Yes USB-C Custom (Linux support) Yes Included Extra Dygma Defy $329 60% Ortholinear Yes USB-C, Bluetooth, RF (WiFi) Custom (Linux support) Yes Included Extra Ultimate Hacking Keyboard $320 60% Staggered Yes USB-C Custom (Linux support) Extra Extra Extra Removable thumb modules ZSA Moonlander $365 60% Ortholinear Yes USB-C QMK Yes Included Included ZSA ErgoDox EZ $354 60% Ortholinear Yes USB-C (as-of Feb 2022) QMK Yes Included Included Keychron Q11 $208 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No Extra None 2 rotary encoders Keebio Sinc $89 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No No No this is a kit only, 1 rotary encoder nullbits SNAP $99 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No No No this is a kit only, 1 rotary encoder Cloud Nine ErgoTKL $169 75% Staggered No USB-C Custom (Windows-only) No Included Included 1 rotary encoder MoErgo Glove80 $399 75% Ortholinear No USB-C, Bluetooth ZMK Yes Included Included Kinesis Advantage360 $449 60% Ortholinear No USB-C Custom (Windows/Mac) Yes Included Included Kinesis Freestyle Pro $179 75% Staggered No USB-A Custom (Windows/Mac) No Extra Extra Kinesis Freestyle2 for PC $99 75% Staggered No USB-A Custom (Windows/Mac) No Extra Extra Requirements I do mostly office work and only a little gaming, so my only hard requirements were 75% layout (I need the F-row and arrow keys) and hotswap sockets. This left the following boards:\nItem Starting price Size Layout Hotswap Connectivity Software Thumb cluster Wrist-wrist Tenting Comments Keychron Q11 $208 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No Extra None 2 rotary encoders Keebio Sinc $89 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No No No this is a kit only, 1 rotary encoder nullbits SNAP $99 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No No No this is a kit only, 1 rotary encoder My purchases Board I ended up purchasing the Keebio Sinc. I was initially looking at the Keychron Q11, but the extra macro keys on the left (below) would make finding keycap sets more difficult (especially if the keys were sculpted).\nImage from Keychron\nThe Sinc comes in a Rev. 3 and Rev. 4 PCB, with the Rev. 4 having an additional circuit for more reliable startup as well as more layout options on the bottom row (see comparison below).\nRev. 3 image from Keebio\nRev. 4 image from Keebio\nBelow are the options I chose for the Sinc Rev. 4.\nSwitches For switches, I like tactile and have been using Cherry MX Clear switches on my CODE board.\nImage from Cherry\nI decided to go with Gateron this time, just to try something different. Gateron Clear switches are linear (not tactile), so I went with the Gateron G Pro 3.0 Brown switches (the Pro series is pre-lubed). Side-note: This page is a great place to compare switches.\nImage from Gateron\nKeycaps The Sinc has a split spacebar, so that removes a lot of options right away. Below are some keycap sets I considered, but ultimately passed on because they don’t have a split spacebar:\nManufacturer Name Profile Material Signature Plastics DSA Granite DSA dye-sublimated PBT Kono SA Granite SA dye-sublimated PBT Kono KDS Solarized Dark Cherry dye-sublimated PBT Novelkeys??? Cherry Milkshake Cherry dye-sublimated PBT Novelkeys??? DSA Milkshake DSA dye-sublimated PBT Drop /dev/tty MT3 dye-sublimated PBT Drop Camillo MT3 doubleshot ABS Below are keycaps that seemed like they would fit the Sinc.\nManufacturer Name Profile Material Comments Milkyway MW Retro Lights Cherry dye-sublimated PBT Domikey DMK Ghost Cherry doubleshot ABS Spacebar kit sold out GMK GMK Foundation Cherry doubleshot ABS Novelties kit sold out GMK GMK DUALSHOT 2 Cherry doubleshot ABS GMK MTNU WOB MTNU doubleshot PBT Pre-order GMK MTNU SUSU MTNU doubleshot PBT Pre-order Signature Plastics DSA Petrikeys DSA doubleshot ABS Would prefer text modifiers Signature Plastics Oblivion V2 SA doubleshot ABS Drop Susuwatari MT3 doubleshot ABS Drop /dev/tty R3 MT3 dye-sublimated PBT Unicorn barf kit sold out Drop DCX Solarized DCX doubleshot ABS PBTfans Cookies ’n Creme Cherry doubleshot ABS PBTfans Retro Dark Lights Cherry doubleshot PBT Prices All-in-all, here is what I purchased.\nItem Price Board (PCB and plates) $134.92 Switches $31 Keycaps $XXX $XXX (total) Build I won’t document the complete build process here, as Keebio already has a build guide (it’s actually for their Quefrency board, but they’re so similar that it works the same).\nFirmware The Sinc supports QMK, but I prefer VIA, since it gives you a GUI and programs in real-time.\nConclusion -Logan\n",

<p>There are a number of ways to solve these problems, but the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; keyboard would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Split in half to allow the arms to naturally rest shoulder-width apart (not bending the wrists)</li>
<li>Each half would be slightly tilted downwards to allow the forearms to sit naturally (not twisting the radius and ulna)</li>
<li>The slope of the keyboard would be minimized (or zero) to allow the wrists to rest naturally (this could also be accomplished by raising the wrists with a rest)</li>
</ol>
<p>It won&rsquo;t win any awards for looks, but the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/freestyle2-keyboard/">Kinesis Freestyle2</a> with the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-vip3-accessory/">VIP3 tenting and palm rest kit</a> is designed to tackle these exact problems (also note the ergonomic vertical mouse).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Kinesis Freestyle2 isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; and is lacking a lot of enthusiast-level niceties (hotswap sockets, QMK support, USB-C, etc&hellip;).</p>
<p>Below are the keyboards I considered. They don&rsquo;t solve all ergonomic challenges, but they&rsquo;re all split boards (you&rsquo;ll need to scroll left and right to see the entire table).</p>

<p>I ended up purchasing the <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/sinc/products/sinc-rev-4-split-staggered-75-keyboard">Keebio Sinc</a>. I was initially looking at the Keychron Q11, but the extra macro keys on the left (below) would make finding keycap sets more difficult (especially if the keys were sculpted).</p>

<p>The Sinc comes in a <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/split-keyboards/products/sinc-split-staggered-75-keyboard">Rev. 3</a> and <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/sinc/products/sinc-rev-4-split-staggered-75-keyboard">Rev. 4</a> PCB, with the Rev. 4 having an additional circuit for more reliable startup as well as more layout options on the bottom row (see comparison below).</p>

<p>Below are the options I chose for the Sinc Rev. 4.</p>

<h2 id="switches">Switches<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#switches">#</a></h2>
<p>For switches, I like tactile and have been using <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-special/mx-clear.html">Cherry MX Clear switches</a> on my CODE board.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="20230718_004_cherry_clear.png"

</figure>

<p>I decided to go with <a href="https://www.gateron.co/">Gateron</a> this time, just to try something different. Gateron Clear switches are linear (not tactile), so I went with the <a href="https://www.gateron.co/products/gateron-g-pro-3-0-switch-set?variant=40479582945369">Gateron G Pro 3.0 Brown switches</a> (the Pro series is pre-lubed). Side-note: <a href="https://thegamingsetup.com/gaming-keyboard/buying-guides/keyboard-switch-chart-table">This page</a> is a great place to compare switches.</p>

<h2 id="keycaps">Keycaps<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#keycaps">#</a></h2>
<p>The Sinc has a split spacebar, so that removes a lot of options right away. Below are some keycap sets I considered, but ultimately passed on because they don&rsquo;t have a split spacebar:</p>
