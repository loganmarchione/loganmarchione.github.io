Introduction ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è\nThis is an image-heavy post (I have lazy-loading enabled, so images should only load as you scroll) My only ‚Äúgood‚Äù lighting is in the kitchen, and I don‚Äôt have a DSLR or macro lens, so excuse the blurry close-up shots and shadows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôve been using a WASD CODE 87-key mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Clear switches since 2017. I liked it so much that I bought another (for when I used to work in the office).\nImage from WASD\nImage from WASD\nI spend a lot of time in front of my computer, both for work and for hobbies. In an effort to not end up with repetitive strain injury years from now, I‚Äôve been looking into more ergonomic keyboards.\nThe search Why ergo? A traditional keyboard can cause a few ergonomic problems:\nUlnar Deviation - This is when your wrists bend outwards (toward your pinky finger) and can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. Image from Kinesis\nForearm Pronation - When typing with your palms face-down, it causes your radius and ulna to twist, which can lead to poor circulation and repetitive strain injuries (RSI). Image from Kinesis\nWrist extension - This is when your wrists bend upwards and can cause poor circulation and numbness. Image from Kinesis\nThere are a number of ways to solve these problems, but the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù keyboard would have the following qualities:\nSplit in half to allow the arms to naturally rest shoulder-width apart (not bending the wrists) Each half would be slightly tilted downwards to allow the forearms to sit naturally (not twisting the radius and ulna) The slope of the keyboard would be minimized (or zero) to allow the wrists to rest naturally (this could also be accomplished by raising the wrists with a rest) It won‚Äôt win any awards for looks, but the Kinesis Freestyle2 with the VIP3 tenting and palm rest kit is designed to tackle these exact problems (also note the ergonomic vertical mouse).\nImage from Kinesis\nMy options Unfortunately, the Kinesis Freestyle2 isn‚Äôt ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù and is lacking a lot of enthusiast-level niceties (hotswap sockets, QMK support, USB-C, etc‚Ä¶).\nBelow are the keyboards I considered. They don‚Äôt solve all ergonomic challenges, but they‚Äôre all split boards (you‚Äôll need to scroll left and right to see the entire table).\nItem Starting price Size Layout Hotswap Connectivity Software Thumb cluster Wrist-wrist Tenting Comments Dygma Raise $399 60% Staggered Yes USB-C Custom (Linux support) Yes Included Extra Dygma Defy $329 60% Ortholinear Yes USB-C, Bluetooth, RF (WiFi) Custom (Linux support) Yes Included Extra Ultimate Hacking Keyboard $320 60% Staggered Yes USB-C Custom (Linux support) Extra Extra Extra Removable thumb modules ZSA Moonlander $365 60% Ortholinear Yes USB-C QMK Yes Included Included ZSA ErgoDox EZ $354 60% Ortholinear Yes USB-C (as-of Feb 2022) QMK Yes Included Included Keychron Q11 $208 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No Extra None 2 rotary encoders Keebio Sinc $89 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No No No this is a kit only, 1 rotary encoder nullbits SNAP $99 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No No No this is a kit only, 1 rotary encoder Cloud Nine ErgoTKL $169 75% Staggered No USB-C Custom (Windows-only) No Included Included 1 rotary encoder MoErgo Glove80 $399 75% Ortholinear No USB-C, Bluetooth ZMK Yes Included Included Kinesis Advantage360 $449 60% Ortholinear No USB-C Custom (Windows/Mac) Yes Included Included Kinesis Freestyle Pro $179 75% Staggered No USB-A Custom (Windows/Mac) No Extra Extra Kinesis Freestyle2 for PC $99 75% Staggered No USB-A Custom (Windows/Mac) No Extra Extra Requirements I do mostly office work and only a little gaming, so my only hard requirements were 75% layout (I wanted the F-row and arrow keys) and hotswap sockets. This left the following boards:\nItem Starting price Size Layout Hotswap Connectivity Software Thumb cluster Wrist-wrist Tenting Comments Keychron Q11 $208 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No Extra None 2 rotary encoders Keebio Sinc $89 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No No No this is a kit only, 1 rotary encoder nullbits SNAP $99 75% Staggered Yes USB-C QMK/VIA No No No this is a kit only, 1 rotary encoder My purchases Board I ended up purchasing the Keebio Sinc. I was initially looking at the Keychron Q11, but the extra macro keys on the left (below) would make finding keycap sets more difficult (especially if the keys were sculpted).\nImage from Keychron\nThe Sinc comes in a Rev. 3 and Rev. 4 PCB, with the Rev. 4 having an additional circuit for more reliable startup as well as more layout options on the bottom row (see comparison below).\nRev. 3 image from Keebio\nRev. 4 image from Keebio\nBelow are the options I chose for the Sinc Rev. 4 (I didn‚Äôt want a left macro-pad and did want a rotary encoder on the right).\nSwitches For switches, I like tactile and have been using Cherry MX Clear switches on my CODE board.\nImage from Cherry\nI decided to go with Gateron this time, just to try something different. Gateron Clear switches are linear (not tactile), so I went with the Gateron G Pro 3.0 Brown switches (the Pro series is pre-lubed). Side-note: This page is a great place to compare switches.\nImage from Gateron\nKeycaps The Sinc has a split spacebar, so that removed a lot of keycap options right away. Below are some keycap sets I considered, but ultimately passed on because they didn‚Äôt have a split spacebar.\nManufacturer Name Profile Material Kono SA Granite SA dye-sublimated PBT Kono KDS Solarized Dark Cherry dye-sublimated PBT Novelkeys??? Cherry Milkshake Cherry dye-sublimated PBT Novelkeys??? DSA Milkshake DSA dye-sublimated PBT Drop /dev/tty MT3 dye-sublimated PBT Drop Camillo MT3 doubleshot ABS In addition to the split spacebar, I also had to decide if I wanted to use a delete/backspace split or a single backspace key (see below).\nRev. 4 image from Keebio\nBelow are keycap sets that seemed like they would fit the Sinc (i.e., they had a split spacebar and a 1U key to take the place of backspace).\nManufacturer Name Profile Material Comments Milkyway MW Retro Lights Cherry dye-sublimated PBT Domikey DMK Ghost Cherry doubleshot ABS Spacebar kit sold out GMK GMK Foundation Cherry doubleshot ABS Novelties kit sold out GMK GMK DUALSHOT 2 Cherry doubleshot ABS GMK MTNU WOB MTNU doubleshot PBT Pre-order GMK MTNU SUSU MTNU doubleshot PBT Pre-order Signature Plastics DSA Granite DSA dye-sublimated PBT Individual keys separate Signature Plastics DSA Petrikeys DSA doubleshot ABS Would prefer text modifiers Signature Plastics Oblivion V2 SA doubleshot ABS Signature Plastics DSS Honeywell DSS doubleshot ABS Drop Susuwatari MT3 doubleshot ABS Drop /dev/tty R3 MT3 dye-sublimated PBT Unicorn barf kit sold out Drop DCX Solarized DCX doubleshot ABS PBTfans Cookies ‚Äôn Creme Cherry doubleshot ABS Would prefer text modifiers PBTfans Retro Dark Lights Cherry doubleshot PBT In the end, I purchased the DCX Solarized set. It didn‚Äôt have a dedicated 1U backspace key, so the F13 key would have to make due.\nImage from Drop\nOther keycaps I also considered these two sets of keycaps, but decided to wait and see how I liked the DCX Solarized.\nOblivion V2 DSA Granite (this would require 2 separate spacebars) Wrist wrest For the CODE, I had purchased a wrist rest (technically palm rest?) from a redditor.\nObviously the Sinc has a split design, so I would need a split wrist rest. I ended up purchasing three, but at the time of this writing, only the first has arrived to my house.\nOKKOwood on Etsy (30 days to arrive from Slovenia) Keychron Wooden Palm Rest (this was actually for the Q11, so I‚Äôm not sure how well it will fit) Digital Carpentry (it turns out this is the same redditor, now with a store!) Prices All-in-all, here is what I purchased. This setup was definitely expensive, but not out of line compared to some of the higher-end boards above (while being more customizable).\nItem Price Board (PCB and plates) $134 Switches $31 Keycaps $99 Wrist/palm rest $70 $334 (total) Build process I won‚Äôt document the complete build process here, as Keebio already has a build video.\nThe first thing was to snap off the macropad on the left side (since I chose plates without the macropad).\nI purchased the Sinc with a rotary encoder on the right side, which takes the place of a switch. This board layout is really clever in that you can choose a rotary encoder or switch in the same slot (see the multiple sets of holes).\nThis was the only soldering required (if you wanted a switch here, then no soldering at all).\nNext were the stabilizers. It took me forever to figure out that they were supposed to be mounted in these castellated mounting holes (i.e., the semi-circles on the very edge of the board).\nAgain, this board layout is really clever and allows a delete/backspace split or a single backspace key (see the three sets of holes). I was going with a delete/backspace split, so I didn‚Äôt add a stabilizer here.\nThe Sinc is powered by a RP2040!\nHere, I added the switches to the plate. After both halves were completed, I plugged it in and tested each switch using VIA.\nHard to see here, but I attached the bottom plate to the top.\nHere is the final product (note that I moved some switches around for the right-side Alt/Super/Ctrl).\nHere are the obligatory blinkenlights.\nYour browser does not support video. Here is the clack clack (unmute the video).\nYour browser does not support video. Here are pictures with the wrist rest.\nBuild process lessons learned I have never built a keyboard before, and to be honest, I was in a little over my head. If I could go back and do things differently, I would say this:\nI had no idea how to assemble the stabilizers (I had to watch YouTube videos) and had to pay attention to the fact that some get installed upside-right, and some upside-down I don‚Äôt know if I should have purchased screw-in stabilizers I had a keycap puller, but didn‚Äôt have a switch puller ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, so I had to use a small screwdriver (I‚Äôve since purchased a switch puller) I should have started with a less flexible board layout (this would have made keycap selection and switch positioning easier) I should have worked my way up to this keyboard kit by building easier boards first (e.g., starting with some barebone boards that only needed to have switches and keycaps installed) In the end, it all worked out perfectly, but it admittedly took much longer than I thought it would.\nFirmware The Sinc supports QMK, but VIA gives you a web interface and programs the board in real-time (i.e., when you change something in VIA, it updates the board right away).\nThis was my first time using VIA, and I was blown away by the options. ü§Ø\nI was able to change so many things:\nremapping keys (e.g., F13 and left-spacebar to backspace) rotary encoder control (turn for volume, press for play/pause) create multiple layers (e.g., FN+H/FN+L to move media tracks backward/forward) so, so, so many RGB options Learning curve Having the keyboard split wasn‚Äôt an issue for typing using the alphabet keys (e.g., QWERTY). However, anything requiring modifiers was a challenge to get used to. For example:\nI‚Äôm still reaching to F13 for backspace, when I should be using my left-spacebar the right-side Shift is smaller than the normal 2.75U the right-side Alt/Super/Ctrl are all 1U the arrow key cluster has no space around it, so I‚Äôm hitting other keys The big win here is that as I find places I can improve, I can tweak my settings on the fly with VIA.\nI‚Äôm not a great typist to begin with, but I think I‚Äôm able to keep up pretty well. I‚Äôm sure as time goes on I‚Äôll become more comfortable.\nConclusion My CODE keyboard was from a time before custom mechanical keyboards were really a thing. I can‚Äôt believe how many options there are now for boards, board layouts, switches, keycaps, and more (I haven‚Äôt even gotten into lubing switches or designing my own board).\nI‚Äôm absolutely amazed by how configurable this board is and how comfortable it is to use. Paired with VIA, this provides so much more flexibility than I‚Äôm used to. I‚Äôm guessing that this will just be the first of many keyboards that I build.\n-Logan\n",

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a <a href="https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/code-v3-87-key-mechanical-keyboard-cherry-mx-clear.html">WASD CODE 87-key mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Clear switches</a> since 2017. I liked it so much that I bought another (for when I used to work in the office).</p>

<p>I spend <em>a lot</em> of time in front of my computer, both for work and for hobbies. In an effort to not end up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">repetitive strain injury</a> years from now, I&rsquo;ve been looking into more ergonomic keyboards.</p>
<h1 id="the-search">The search<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-search">#</a></h1>
<h2 id="why-ergo">Why ergo?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-ergo">#</a></h2>
<p>A traditional keyboard can cause a few ergonomic problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ulnar Deviation - This is when your wrists bend outwards (toward your pinky finger) and can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
</ol>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="20230717_001.jpg"
         alt="ulnar deviation" width="50%"/> <figcaption>
            <p>
                    <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/solutions/keyboard-risk-factors/">Image from Kinesis</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<ol start="2">
<li>Forearm Pronation - When typing with your palms face-down, it causes your radius and ulna to twist, which can lead to poor circulation and repetitive strain injuries (RSI).</li>
</ol>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="20230717_002.jpg"
         alt="forearm pronation" width="50%"/> <figcaption>
            <p>
                    <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/solutions/keyboard-risk-factors/">Image from Kinesis</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<ol start="3">
<li>Wrist extension - This is when your wrists bend upwards and can cause poor circulation and numbness.</li>
</ol>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="20230717_003.jpg"
         alt="wrist extension" width="50%"/> <figcaption>
            <p>
                    <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/solutions/keyboard-risk-factors/">Image from Kinesis</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are a number of ways to solve these problems, but the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; keyboard would have the following qualities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Split in half to allow the arms to naturally rest shoulder-width apart (not bending the wrists)</li>
<li>Each half would be slightly tilted downwards to allow the forearms to sit naturally (not twisting the radius and ulna)</li>
<li>The slope of the keyboard would be minimized (or zero) to allow the wrists to rest naturally (this could also be accomplished by raising the wrists with a rest)</li>
</ol>
<p>It won&rsquo;t win any awards for looks, but the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/freestyle2-keyboard/">Kinesis Freestyle2</a> with the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-vip3-accessory/">VIP3 tenting and palm rest kit</a> is designed to tackle these exact problems (also note the ergonomic vertical mouse).</p>

<h2 id="my-options">My options<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#my-options">#</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the Kinesis Freestyle2 isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; and is lacking a lot of enthusiast-level niceties (hotswap sockets, QMK support, USB-C, etc&hellip;).</p>
<p>Below are the keyboards I considered. They don&rsquo;t solve all ergonomic challenges, but they&rsquo;re all split boards (you&rsquo;ll need to scroll left and right to see the entire table).</p>

<p>I ended up purchasing the <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/sinc/products/sinc-rev-4-split-staggered-75-keyboard">Keebio Sinc</a>. I was initially looking at the Keychron Q11, but the extra macro keys on the left (below) would make finding keycap sets more difficult (especially if the keys were sculpted).</p>

<p>The Sinc comes in a <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/split-keyboards/products/sinc-split-staggered-75-keyboard">Rev. 3</a> and <a href="https://keeb.io/collections/sinc/products/sinc-rev-4-split-staggered-75-keyboard">Rev. 4</a> PCB, with the Rev. 4 having an additional circuit for more reliable startup as well as more layout options on the bottom row (see comparison below).</p>

<p>Below are the options I chose for the Sinc Rev. 4 (I didn&rsquo;t want a left macro-pad and did want a rotary encoder on the right).</p>

<h2 id="switches">Switches<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#switches">#</a></h2>
<p>For switches, I like tactile and have been using <a href="https://www.cherrymx.de/en/cherry-mx/mx-special/mx-clear.html">Cherry MX Clear switches</a> on my CODE board.</p>

<p>I decided to go with <a href="https://www.gateron.co/">Gateron</a> this time, just to try something different. Gateron Clear switches are linear (not tactile), so I went with the <a href="https://www.gateron.co/products/gateron-g-pro-3-0-switch-set?variant=40479582945369">Gateron G Pro 3.0 Brown switches</a> (the Pro series is pre-lubed). Side-note: <a href="https://thegamingsetup.com/gaming-keyboard/buying-guides/keyboard-switch-chart-table">This page</a> is a great place to compare switches.</p>

<h2 id="keycaps">Keycaps<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#keycaps">#</a></h2>
<p>The Sinc has a split spacebar, so that removed a lot of keycap options right away. Below are some keycap sets I considered, but ultimately passed on because they didn&rsquo;t have a split spacebar.</p>

<p>In addition to the split spacebar, I also had to decide if I wanted to use a delete/backspace split or a single backspace key (see below).</p>

<p>In the end, I purchased the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-dcx-solarized-keycap-set">DCX Solarized</a> set. It didn&rsquo;t have a dedicated 1U backspace key, so the F13 key would have to make due.</p>

<p>For the CODE, I had purchased a wrist rest (technically palm rest?) from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/hcb1v5/artisan_custom_wrist_rests_and_giveaway/">redditor</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously the Sinc has a split design, so I would need a split wrist rest. I ended up purchasing three, but at the time of this writing, only the first has arrived to my house.</p>

<h1 id="build-process">Build process<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#build-process">#</a></h1>
<p>I won&rsquo;t document the complete build process here, as Keebio already has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0lVrFJ1gDc">build video</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing was to snap off the macropad on the left side (since I chose plates without the macropad).</p>

<p><img src="/2023/08/keebio-sinc-split-keyboard/20230821_001_hua3ae95a2c16ef672f19dd8750d4ae9fd_484694_800x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="macropad"></p>

<p><img src="/2023/08/keebio-sinc-split-keyboard/20230821_002_hu0a6c8483199587c973ed4ba16143befa_507949_800x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="macropad"></p>
<p>I purchased the Sinc with a rotary encoder on the right side, which takes the place of a switch. This board layout is really clever in that you can choose a rotary encoder or switch in the same slot (see the multiple sets of holes).</p>

<p><img src="/2023/08/keebio-sinc-split-keyboard/20230821_003.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="rotary encoder"></p>
<p>This was the only soldering required (if you wanted a switch here, then no soldering at all).</p>

<p><img src="/2023/08/keebio-sinc-split-keyboard/20230821_004.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="rotary encoder"></p>
<p>Next were the stabilizers. It took me forever to figure out that they were supposed to be mounted in these <a href="https://www.pcbdirectory.com/community/what-are-castellated-holes-on-a-pcb">castellated mounting holes</a> (i.e., the semi-circles on the very edge of the board).</p>

<p><img src="/2023/08/keebio-sinc-split-keyboard/20230821_005_hu8cd8954545cae775962363a60629d06c_284164_800x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="castellated mounting holes"></p>
<p>Again, this board layout is really clever and allows a delete/backspace split or a single backspace key (see the three sets of holes). I was going with a delete/backspace split, so I didn&rsquo;t add a stabilizer here.</p>

<p><img src="/2023/08/keebio-sinc-split-keyboard/20230821_007.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="backspace key"></p>
<p>The Sinc is powered by a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/">RP2040</a>!</p>

<p><img src="/2023/08/keebio-sinc-split-keyboard/20230821_006.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="rp2040"></p>
<p>Here, I added the switches to the plate. After both halves were completed, I plugged it in and tested each switch using VIA.</p>

<p>Hard to see here, but I attached the bottom plate to the top.</p>

<p><img src="/2023/08/keebio-sinc-split-keyboard/20230821_010.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="attached bottom plate"></p>
<p>Here is the final product (note that I moved some switches around for the right-side Alt/Super/Ctrl).</p>

<h2 id="build-process-lessons-learned">Build process lessons learned<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#build-process-lessons-learned">#</a></h2>
<p>I have never built a keyboard before, and to be honest, I was in a little over my head. If I could go back and do things differently, I would say this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had no idea how to assemble the stabilizers (I had to watch YouTube videos) and had to pay attention to the fact that some get installed upside-right, and some upside-down</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know if I should have purchased screw-in stabilizers</li>
<li>I had a keycap puller, but didn&rsquo;t have a switch puller ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, so I had to use a small screwdriver (I&rsquo;ve since purchased a switch puller)</li>
<li>I should have started with a less flexible board layout (this would have made keycap selection and switch positioning easier)</li>
<li>I should have worked my way up to this keyboard kit by building easier boards first (e.g., starting with some barebone boards that only needed to have switches and keycaps installed)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, it all worked out perfectly, but it admittedly took much longer than I thought it would.</p>
<h1 id="firmware">Firmware<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#firmware">#</a></h1>
<p>The Sinc <a href="https://docs.keeb.io/flashing-firmware">supports QMK</a>, but <a href="https://docs.keeb.io/via">VIA</a> gives you a <a href="https://usevia.app/">web interface</a> and programs the board in real-time (i.e., when you change something in VIA, it updates the board right away).</p>
<p>This was my first time using VIA, and I was blown away by the options. ü§Ø</p>
<p>I was able to change so many things:</p>
<ul>
<li>remapping keys (e.g., F13 and left-spacebar to backspace)</li>
<li>rotary encoder control (turn for volume, press for play/pause)</li>
<li>create multiple layers (e.g., FN+H/FN+L to move media tracks backward/forward)</li>
<li>so, so, so many RGB options</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/2023/08/keebio-sinc-split-keyboard/20230822_002.png" loading="lazy" alt="via"></p>
<h1 id="learning-curve">Learning curve<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#learning-curve">#</a></h1>
<p>Having the keyboard split wasn&rsquo;t an issue for typing using the alphabet keys (e.g., QWERTY). However, anything requiring modifiers was a challenge to get used to. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m still reaching to F13 for backspace, when I should be using my left-spacebar</li>
<li>the right-side Shift is smaller than the normal 2.75U</li>
<li>the right-side Alt/Super/Ctrl are all 1U</li>
<li>the arrow key cluster has no space around it, so I&rsquo;m hitting other keys</li>
</ul>
<p>The big win here is that as I find places I can improve, I can tweak my settings on the fly with VIA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a great typist to begin with, but I think I&rsquo;m able to keep up pretty well. I&rsquo;m sure as time goes on I&rsquo;ll become more comfortable.</p>

<p><img src="/2023/08/keebio-sinc-split-keyboard/20230829_001_hu0717c389df8e1166d384565ebe274840_82319_800x0_resize_catmullrom_3.png" loading="lazy" alt="monkey type"></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h1>
<p>My CODE keyboard was from a time before custom mechanical keyboards were really a thing. I can&rsquo;t believe how many options there are now for boards, board layouts, switches, keycaps, and more (I haven&rsquo;t even gotten into lubing switches or designing my own board).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely amazed by how configurable this board is and how comfortable it is to use. Paired with VIA, this provides so much more flexibility than I&rsquo;m used to. I&rsquo;m guessing that this will just be the first of many keyboards that I build.</p>
