Since then, I’ve hit the 1000 comment mark (although technically, some comments are my own replies to your comments). To thank my readers, I’m giving away two Raspberry Pi 3 Complete Starter Kit (32 GB Edition) by CanaKit.\nI have a very similar kit, and it’s a great way to get introduced to Linux, or build something new. With a Raspberry Pi 3, you can:\ncreate a HTPC media streaming server turn a “dumb” TV into a “smart” TV setup a NAS setup a print server create an old-school game emulator (using RetroPie) learn programming replace your (really) old desktop play Minecraft build robots extend your home network setup your own cloud (using NextCloud) host a website block ads on your network (Pi-hole is great for this) build your own smart assistant run a crytocurrency node (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, etc…) run your own VPN server Because I spend a lot of time on reddit, and have received so much help on reddit over the years, I’ll be advertising on the following subreddits that have helped along the way (sorry, I don’t like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc…).\nr/homelab - messaged mods, didn’t hear back r/linux - mods OKed r/selfhosted - mods OKed r/Ubiquiti - messaged mods, didn’t hear back r/CryptoCurrency - mods OKed r/MiniPCs - messaged mods, didn’t hear back r/linux_devices - messaged mods, didn’t hear back r/linuxmasterrace - messaged mods, didn’t hear back Eligibility requirements You must be age 18 or older (sorry, kids), and reside in the United States of America (sorry, Canada). You must reside at an address that Amazon.com will deliver to, in the United States of America. You must comment between 12/5 at noon (Eastern time) and 12/8 at noon (Eastern time). How to enter Leave one comment on this post - anything will do (duplicate comments won’t be counted). When leaving your comment, use a working email address so I can reply to you if you are chosen (i.e., don’t use a temporary email). I’ll be using the Pick Giveaway Winner plugin (WordPress link, GitHub link) to choose two winners at random (duplicate comments won’t be counted). Once a winner is chosen, I’ll email you via the email you provided to request your name and mailing address to ship you the item. You’ll have 24 hours to respond. If you do not respond within 24 hours, I will choose another winner (who will then have 24 hours to respond). If you do respond within 24 hours, I’ll purchase the item from Amazon.com and it will ship directly to you. After the item is purchased and shipped, I’ll post your first name and the link to your comment at the top of this post. Your last name and email address will not be published. Some legal stuff You must be age 18 or older (sorry, kids), and reside in the United States of America (sorry, Canada). You must reside at an address that Amazon.com will deliver to, in the United States of America. You must comment between 12/5 at noon (Eastern time) and 12/8 at noon (Eastern time). No purchase is necessary for entry. You are not required to like or subscribe to this blog for entry. The number of eligible entries received determine the odds of winning. This is technically a sweepstakes (because winners are chosen randomly). This is not: a contest, because no merit or skill is involved a lottery, because no tickets are sold (plus, I’m not a government) a raffle, because no tickets are sold The winner will not pay for the item, taxes, or shipping. I will store your name and mailing address for the purpose of delivering the item. Void where prohibited by law. By submitting a comment, you are agreeing to the terms on this page, as well as my Privacy Policy. Good luck!\n-Logan\nComments Old comments from WordPress\n",

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h1>
<p>Since 2014, I&rsquo;ve been blogging about security, open source, Linux, and routers. Since then, I&rsquo;ve hit the 1000 comment mark (although technically, some comments are my own replies to your comments). To thank my readers, I&rsquo;m giving away two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit/dp/B01C6Q2GSY/">Raspberry Pi 3 Complete Starter Kit (32 GB Edition)</a> by <a href="https://www.canakit.com/">CanaKit</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/2017/12/celebrating-1000-comments-by-giving-away-a-raspberry-pi-3/20171116_001_hu14403708eddc5ad44afb166262642272_403575_800x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>I have a very similar kit, and it&rsquo;s a great way to get introduced to Linux, or build something new. With a Raspberry Pi 3, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a HTPC media streaming server</li>
<li>turn a &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; TV into a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; TV</li>
<li>setup a NAS</li>
<li>setup a print server</li>
<li>create an old-school game emulator (using <a href="https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki">RetroPie</a>)</li>
<li>learn programming</li>
<li>replace your (really) old desktop</li>
<li>play Minecraft</li>
<li>build robots</li>
<li>extend your home network</li>
<li>setup your own cloud (using <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">NextCloud</a>)</li>
<li>host a website</li>
<li>block ads on your network (<a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki">Pi-hole</a> is great for this)</li>
<li>build your own smart assistant</li>
<li>run a crytocurrency node (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, etc&hellip;)</li>
<li>run your own VPN server</li>
</ul>
<p>Because I spend a lot of time on reddit, and have received so much help on reddit over the years, I&rsquo;ll be advertising on the following subreddits that have helped along the way (sorry, I don&rsquo;t like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc&hellip;).</p>

<li>I&rsquo;ll be using the Pick Giveaway Winner plugin (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pick-giveaway-winner/">WordPress link</a>, <a href="https://github.com/makeworthymedia/pick-giveaway-winner">GitHub link</a>) to choose two winners at random (duplicate comments won&rsquo;t be counted).</li>
<li>Once a winner is chosen, I&rsquo;ll email you via the email you provided to request your name and mailing address to ship you the item.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll have 24 hours to respond.
<ul>
<li>If you do not respond within 24 hours, I will choose another winner (who will then have 24 hours to respond).</li>
<li>If you do respond within 24 hours, I&rsquo;ll purchase the item from Amazon.com and it will ship directly to you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the item is purchased and shipped, I&rsquo;ll post your first name and the link to your comment at the top of this post. Your last name and email address will not be published.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<ol>
<li>You must be age 18 or older (sorry, kids), and reside in the United States of America (sorry, Canada).</li>
<li>You must reside at an address that Amazon.com will deliver to, in the United States of America.</li>
<li>You must comment between 12/5 at noon (Eastern time) and 12/8 at noon (Eastern time).</li>
<li>No purchase is necessary for entry.</li>
<li>You are not required to like or subscribe to this blog for entry.</li>
<li>The number of eligible entries received determine the odds of winning.</li>
<li>This is technically a sweepstakes (because winners are chosen randomly). This is not:
<ul>
<li>a contest, because no merit or skill is involved</li>
<li>a lottery, because no tickets are sold (plus, I&rsquo;m not a government)</li>
<li>a raffle, because no tickets are sold</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The winner will not pay for the item, taxes, or shipping.</li>
<li>I will store your name and mailing address for the purpose of delivering the item.</li>
<li>Void where prohibited by law.</li>
<li>By submitting a comment, you are agreeing to the terms on this page, as well as my <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck!</p>
